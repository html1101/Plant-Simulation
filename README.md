# Plant-Simulation
Plant simulation; reproduces Gregor Mendel's research on pea plants by following the seven characteristics. The player interacts in the three dimensional world, planting vegetation in a field and aspiring to create a garden. They can play in educational mode, in which they predict the results of a Punnett square in mechanical pollination, or in creative mode, in which they can experiment and allow for cross-pollination and self pollination.
